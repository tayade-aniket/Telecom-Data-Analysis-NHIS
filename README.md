## 🌟 Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive data analysis of **TellCo's telecom dataset**, providing critical insights to inform a strategic investment decision. [cite_start]As an analyst for a wealthy investor, the goal is to uncover opportunities for growth and assess TellCo's overall value by examining customer behavior and network performance. 

## 🎯 Business Context & Objective

[cite_start]The investor specializes in acquiring undervalued assets and relies on detailed data analysis to understand business fundamentals and drive profitability. [cite_start]TellCo, a mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia, has shared financial data but lacks insights from its system-generated data.

[cite_start]**Objective:** To analyze growth opportunities and recommend whether TellCo is a worthy acquisition, leveraging a detailed telecommunication dataset.

## 💾 Dataset

[cite_start]The analysis is based on a simulated **telecom xDR (data sessions Detail Record)** dataset, encompassing aggregated data from one month.  It provides rich information on:

* [cite_start]**User Behavior:** Tracking activities across popular applications like Social Media, Google, Email, YouTube, Netflix, Gaming, and Others. 
* [cite_start]**Network Performance:** Key metrics such as TCP retransmission, Round Trip Time (RTT), and Throughput. 
* **Device Information:** Details on Handset Manufacturer and Handset Type.

## 🚀 Key Analysis Areas

The project systematically addresses four core sub-objectives to provide a holistic view of TellCo's operations and customer base:

### 1. User Overview Analysis 👤
[cite_start]Familiarizing with the dataset, identifying top handsets and manufacturers, and interpreting initial insights into user behavior and device preferences. 

### 2. User Engagement Analysis 💡
Quantifying user engagement based on session frequency, duration, and total data traffic. [cite_start]This involves segmenting customers into different engagement clusters (e.g., low, medium, high) using K-Means clustering. 

### 3. User Experience Analysis 🌐
Evaluating customer experience by focusing on critical network parameters like Average RTT, Average Throughput, and TCP Retransmission volumes. [cite_start]Users are segmented into experience groups to identify areas of poor service quality. 

### 4. User Satisfaction Analysis 😊
A composite satisfaction score is derived by combining insights from both user engagement and experience analyses. [cite_start]This helps in identifying highly satisfied users and those at high risk of churn, providing a foundation for targeted retention strategies. 

## ✨ Insights & Recommendations

The analysis culminates in a comprehensive investment recommendation for TellCo, backed by data-driven insights:

* [cite_start]**Growth Potential Assessment:** Identifying segments (e.g., high-engagement users, demand for high-bandwidth apps) that offer significant opportunities for revenue growth. 
* [cite_start]**Limitations & Risks:** Acknowledging the constraints of the analysis (e.g., simulated data, lack of churn data, competitive landscape) and potential risks involved. 
* **Strategic Recommendations:** Outlining actionable steps for post-acquisition, including network optimization, personalized offers, and churn prevention programs.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Language:** Python 🐍
* **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (for K-Means clustering, PCA)
* **Statistical Analysis:** `scipy`
